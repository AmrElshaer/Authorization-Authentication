# Role-Based Authorization with Claims Transformation

This documentation covers the implementation of a role-based authorization system with dynamic claims transformation and permission handling in .NET Core.


## Overview

The system provides a flexible authorization framework that combines:
- Role-based access control
- Dynamic claims transformation
- Permission-based authorization
- Custom policy 

## Features

- Dynamic claims transformation based on user roles
- Custom permission requirements
- Role to permission mapping
- Tenant-based permissions
- Middleware ensuring correct execution order
- Extensible authorization handlers


### ClaimsTransformer

Responsible for:
- Converting roles to permissions
- Adding tenant-specific claims
- Transforming external claims
- Ensuring claims consistency

### PermissionAuthorizationHandler

Handles:
- Permission requirement validation
- Policy enforcement
- Authorization decisions

### ClaimsTransformationMiddleware

Ensures:
- Correct execution order
- Claims transformation before authorization
- Consistent pipeline behavior

## Best Practices

1. **Claims Transformation**
   - Keep transformations lightweight
   - Cache when possible
   - Use async operations
   - Handle errors gracefully

2. **Permission Management**
   - Use hierarchical permissions
   - Follow least privilege principle
   - Document permission structures
   - Regular audit of permissions

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Cache role-permission mappings
   - Minimize database calls
   - Use efficient claim lookups
   - Monitor transformation overhead

4. **Security Guidelines**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Log authorization failures
   - Regular security audits
   - Keep dependencies updated

## Extension Points

The system can be extended in several ways:


## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Claims Not Being Transformed**
   - Verify middleware order
   - Check authentication status
   - Validate transformation logic

2. **Permission Denied Unexpectedly**
   - Check claims transformation
   - Verify policy configuration
   - Review role mappings

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Implement caching
   - Optimize database queries
   - Review transformation logic

## Contributing
